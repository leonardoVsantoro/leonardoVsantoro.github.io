      alt: ot
    description: Optimal transport (OT) arises as a mean for comparing probability measures. It endows the space of probability measures with a peculiar geometrical structure, paving the way for its application in statistics, machine learning, and applied mathematics.
  - title: Functional Data Analysis

      alt: fda
    description: Functional data analysis (FDA) is a branch of statistics that analyses data providing information about curves, surfaces or anything else varying over a continuum. In its most general form, under an FDA framework, each sample element of functional data is considered to be a random function.
