My research focuses on:
  - title: Statistical Optimal Transport

      alt: ot
    description: Optimal transport (OT) arises as a mean for comparing probability measures. It endows the space of probability measures with a peculiar geometrical structure, paving the way for its application in statistics, machine learning, and applied mathematics.
  - title: Functional Data Analysis

      alt: fda
    description: Functional data analysis (FDA) is a branch of statistics that analyses data providing information about curves, surfaces or anything else varying over a continuum. In its most general form, under an FDA framework, each sample element of functional data is considered to be a random function.

  I am a PhD candidate at EPFL advised by <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/victor.panaretos">Victor Panaretos</a> in the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/smat/">chair of Mathematical Statistics</a>.
<p>
    
<p>
I am interested in statistical inference for random processes and inverse problems arising in the context of optimal transport and functional data analysis. 
This often brings me in close contact with pure/applied probability, optimisation and data science.
