<p>
  I am a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL in the chair of <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/smat/">Mathematical Statistics</a>, where I obtained my PhD advised by <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/victor.panaretos">Victor Panaretos</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in statistical inference for random processes and inverse problems arising in the context of \textbf{high-dimensional} and \textbf{functional data analysis}, as well as \textbf{optimal transport}, with a focus on \textbf{optimization} and an eye toward real-world applications. While my work is rooted in statistics, it has deep connections to applied probability, data science and optimization.
