<p>
  I am a PhD candidate at EPFL supervised by prof. Victor Panaretos <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/victor.panaretos">website</a> focusing on Mathematical Statistics.
I am interested in statistical inference for random processes and inverse problems arising in the context of optimal transport and functional data analysis. 
This often brings me in close contact with pure/applied probability, optimisation, machine learning and data science.
