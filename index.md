<p>
  I am a PhD candidate at EPFL supervised by prof. <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/victor.panaretos">Victor Panaretos</a> focusing on Mathematical Statistics.
<p>
    
<p>
I am interested in statistical inference for random processes and inverse problems arising in the context of optimal transport and functional data analysis. 
This often brings me in close contact with pure/applied probability, optimisation, machine learning and data science.
