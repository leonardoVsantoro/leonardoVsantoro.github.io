<p>
  I am a postdoctoral researcher at EPFL in the chair of <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/smat/">Mathematical Statistics</a>, where I obtained my PhD advised by <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/victor.panaretos">Victor Panaretos</a>.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in statistical inference for random processes and inverse problems arising in the context of high-dimensional and functional data analysis and optimal transport. 
This often brings me in close contact with pure/applied probability, optimisation and data science.
